<h1>How to review</h1>

<p>This guide explains how to review blog posts created by me, Joakim Tengstrand.</p>
<p>The review process is handled by Hypothesis, an open-source tool, and you won't be exposed to ads or tracking when using it!</p>

<p>To start reviewing, click on the writing icon in the upper right margin (marked with an orange box in the image below):</p>

<p><img src="assets/review.png" alt="Review window" style="border: 1px solid #ccc;"></p>

<p>If you haven't already, create an account and login. If the popup window doesn't close automatically, you need to close it manually (this is a known problem).</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>After you have logged in, you can start doing reviews:</p>

<ol>
<li>Highlight the text you want to comment on</li>
<li>Click on the small writing icon (✏️) that appears when you highlight text to open the comment dialog</li>
<li>Write your comment in the dialog that opens</li>
<li>Save your comment</li>
</ol>

<p>Your comments will appear as highlights on the page and others who are logged in can see and reply to them.</p>
